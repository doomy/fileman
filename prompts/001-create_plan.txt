I want to create a micro-web application for managing uploaded files in a specified location in similar vein to CKfinder. 
The backend should be a REST api written in PHP.
I will let you choose the frontend stack based on what is most suited for the current task, well enough notorious and future-proof.
At this point, do not generate any code. Just plan the creation, separate it into meaningful steps to cand write it to a comprehensible document in <app_root>/plan.MD. We will continue from there.
